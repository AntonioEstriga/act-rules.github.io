## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

For each [section of content][] in the test target, the first node in the [flat tree][] which is inside this [section of content][] and has a non-empty [accessible name][]:

- has a [semantic role][] of `heading`; and
- is [visible][]; and
- is [included in the accessibility tree][].

**Note**: Neither this rule, nor technique [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69], expects the heading to accurately describe its corresponding section. However, having non descriptive headings fails [Success Criterion 2.4.6: Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels)

**Note**: Neither this rule, nor technique [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69], expects that headings are correctly nested without skipping level. It is nonetheless recommended to nest headings hierarchically without skipping levels.

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that headings used to pass technique [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69] have to be [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][] in order to be beneficial to all users whether they are using assistive technologies or not.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

**Note to reviewers**: In its current state, the definition of [section of content][] would include, e.g. an advertising sidebar as a specific section of content. However, it is not clear that the lack of heading on it would be a breach of H69 or SC 2.4.1… Idea?

## Background

- [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69]
- [CSS Scoping (work in progress)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)

## Test Cases

**Note**: The text of the examples is from the translation of the first Chapter of _The Three Kingdoms_ by Yu Sumei (Tuttle publishing, May 2014). The image is public domain, excerpt from a Ming Dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the original is kept in the library holdings of Peking University.

**Note**: Unless specified otherwise, the [sections of content][section of content] of each document are defined by the [landmarks][landmark] (`main` and `nav` elements).

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [document][] has one [section of content][] for the navigation links, and one for the actual text. Each starts with a `h1` heading.

**Note**: In this [document][], the [sections of content][section of content] are identified by the level 1 heading at their start.

```html
<html>
	<!-- Navigational section of content starts here -->
	<h1>Contents</h1>
	<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	<!-- Navigational section of content ends here -->

	<!-- Main section of content starts here -->
	<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
	Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
	time.
	<!-- Main section of content ends here -->
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

In this [document][], headings are not the first elements of each [section of content][], but they are the first with a non-empty [accessible name][]. The [accessible name][] of the second heading is inherited from its content.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<hr />
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<hr />
		<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The image at the start of the second [section of content][] does not have an [accessible name][]. Thus, the first node with an [accessible name][] is the `h1` element and the rule passes.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<img src="../test-assets/document-headings-047fe0/peach-garden-oath.jpg" role="presentation" alt="" />
		<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This [document][] has one [section of content][] for the navigation links, and one for the actual text. Each starts with a `div` with a role of `heading`.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<div role="heading" aria-level="1">Contents</div>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<div role="heading" aria-level="1">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</div>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This [document][] is using image as heading, the [accessible name][] of the image (given by the `alt` attribute) is also the [accessible name][] of the heading.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1>
			<img
				src="../test-assets/document-headings-047fe0/peach-garden-oath.jpg"
				alt="Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden"
			/>
		</h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

For the second [section of content][], the first node with a non-empty [accessible name][] does not have a [semantic role][] of `heading`, even though it is styled to appear as one.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
	<h1>Contents</h1>h1></h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<strong style="font-size: 18pt">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</strong>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The heading of the second [section of content][] is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1 aria-hidden="true">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The [accessible name][] of the image used as heading for the second [section of content][], which is also the [accessible name][] of the heading, is empty. Hence, the first node with a non-empty [accessible name][] is the text below, which does not have a [semantic role][] of `heading`.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1><img src="../test-assets/document-headings-047fe0/peach-garden-oath.jpg" alt=" " /></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The `h1` element that starts the second [section of content][] is not [visible][] because it is off screen.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1 style="position: absolute; top:-999px">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```
