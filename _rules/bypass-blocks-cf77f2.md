## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element) is an HTML `<html>` element.

## Expectation

For each test target, the outcome of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [HTML page has a main landmark](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/b40fd1)
- [First focusable element is an internal link](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/e53727)


For each test target, the outcome of at least one of the following rules is passed:
- (G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block)
- (G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content)
- (H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content)
- (H70: Using frame elements to group blocks of repeated material AND H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements)
- (SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content)

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that the document has blocks of content that are repeated in multiple documents within the same website. If this is not the case, there is no requirement for the type of mechanism tested in this rule.

## Accessibility Support

Techniques and solutions that identify regions of the page are perfectly valid ways of passing 2.4.1 Bypass blocks. They are, however, directed toward screen readers users and keyboard users will not benefit for these. Techniques and solutions based on links will benefit all users and are therefore recommended. 

Whereas the techniques [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11), [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H69), and [H70: Using frame elements to group blocks of repeated material](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H70) and [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H64) are perfectly valid ways of passing 2.4.1. Bypass Blocks, these solutions are directed towards screen reader users, and keyboard users will not benefit from these. The solutions with links for bypassing blocks will benefit all users.
