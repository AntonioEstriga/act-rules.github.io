## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectation 1

The first [focusable][] element within the test target:

- is [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- is [visible][] when [focused][]; and
- has a [semantic role][] of link; and
- when activated, moves focus to the main [section of content][] of the [document][]; and
- has either an [accessible name][] or [accessible description][] that communicates that it links to the main [section of content][].

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that any global dismissible information that only appears once per site has already been acknowledged and is not displayed any more.

**Note**: The aim of such link is to be able to skip [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] (headers, navigation bar, ...) when viewing several pages of the same site. Many sites display a cookies policy banner which might be stealing focus until dismissed (usually by viewing and accepting cookies policy). Since that content is _not_ repeated (is it only shown once for the full site), it is not a problem to have it, and it may appear on any page of the site (depending where the user first comes in).

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) is [visible][], is [included in the accessibility tree][], and when activated moves the focus to the main [section of content][] identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated Content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) can be toggled to [visible][] through keyboard focus. When activated the focus is moved to the main [section of content][] identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			#skipNav a {
				height: 100px;
				position: absolute;
				top: -100px;
			}
			#skipNav a:focus {
				top: 0px;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="skipNav">
			<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
		</nav>
		<div id="repeated-content">
			<!-- Repeated content -->
		</div>
		<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) has an `aria-label` attribute to provide an [accessible name][]. When activated focus is moved to the main [section of content][] identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content" aria-label="Skip to main content"></a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

### Failed

```html
<html>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) is not the first [focusable][] element within the `body`.

	<a href="https://www.w3.org/">Check out the W3C</a>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) does not have an [accessible name][].

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content"></a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) does not reference a valid `id` attribute and when activated will not move focus to the main [section of content][] identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<a href="#invalidId">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 5

The link to skip [repeated content](#repeated-content) is not [visible][], and is not included in the [accessibility tree][].

```html
<html>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content" style="display:none;">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 6

		<span onclick="focusMainContent()">Skip to main content</span>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
