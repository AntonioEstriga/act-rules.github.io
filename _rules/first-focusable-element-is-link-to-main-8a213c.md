## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element.

## Expectation 1

The first [focusable](#focusable) element within the test target:
- is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree); and
- is [visible](#visible) when [focused](#focused); and
- has a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of link; and
- when activated, moves focus to the [main content](#main-content) of the [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document); and
- has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) that communicates that it links to the [main content](#main-content).

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that any global dismissible information that only appears once per site has already been acknowledged and is not displayed any more.

**Note**: The aim of such link is to be able to skip repeated content (headers, navigation bar, ...) when viewing several pages of the same site. Many sites display a cookies policy banner which might be stealing focus until dismissed (usually be viewing and accepting cookies policy). Since that content is *not* repeated (is it only shown once for the full site), it is not a problem to have it, and it may appear on any page of the site (depending where the user first comes in).

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1)
