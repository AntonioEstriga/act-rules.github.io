## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element.

## Expectation 1

The first [focusable](#focusable) element within the test target:

- is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree); and
- is [visible](#visible) when [focused](#focused); and
- has a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of link; and
- when activated, moves focus to the [main content](#main-content) of the [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document); and
- has either an [accessible name](#accessible-name) or [accessible description](#accessible-description) that communicates that it links to the [main content](#main-content).

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that any global dismissible information that only appears once per site has already been acknowledged and is not displayed any more.

**Note**: The aim of such link is to be able to skip repeated content (headers, navigation bar, ...) when viewing several pages of the same site. Many sites display a cookies policy banner which might be stealing focus until dismissed (usually be viewing and accepting cookies policy). Since that content is _not_ repeated (is it only shown once for the full site), it is not a problem to have it, and it may appear on any page of the site (depending where the user first comes in).

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The link to skip repeated content is [visible](#visible), is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree), and when activated moves the focus to the main content identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated Content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The link to skip repeated content can be toggled to [visible](#visible) through keyboard focus. When activated the focus is moved to the main content identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<body>
	<style>
		#skipNav a {
			height: 100px;
			position: absolute;
			top: -100px;
		}
		#skipNav a:focus {
			top: 0px;
		}
	</style>
	<nav id="skipNav">
		<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The link to skip repeated content has an `aria-label` to provide an [accessible name](#accessible-name). When activated focus is moved to the main content identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content" aria-label="Skip to main content"></a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

### Failed

There is no link to skip repeated content.

```html
<body>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The link to skip repeated content is not the first focusable element within the `body`.

```html
<body>
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/">Check out the W3C</a>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The link to skip repeated content does not have an [accessible name](#accessible-name).

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content"></a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The link to skip repeated content does not reference a valid `id` and when activated will not move focus to the main content identified here by the `main` element.

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<a href="#invalidId">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Failed Example 5

The link to skip repeated content is not [visible](#visible), and is not included in the [accessibility tree](#accessibility-tree).

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<a href="#main-content" style="display:none;">Skip to main content</a>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
</body>
```

#### Failed Example 6

The element with a click event to skip repeated content does not have a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of link.

```html
<body>
	<nav>
		<span onClick="focusMainContent()">Skip to main content</span>
	</nav>
	<div id="repeated-content">
		<!-- Repeated content -->
	</div>
	<main id="main-content">Main Content</main>
	<script>
		function focusMainContent() {
			document.getElementById('main-content').focus()
		}
	</script>
</body>
```
