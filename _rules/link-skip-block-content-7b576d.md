## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

For each [section of repeated content][] within the test target, either the last [focusable][] element which is before any [focusable][] element inside this [section of repeated content][], or the first [focusable][] element which is inside this [section of repeated content][]:

- has a [semantic role][] of `link`; and
- is [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- is [visible][] when [focused][]; and
- can be activated by use of keyboard only; and
- when activated, moves keyboard focus to the first element in the [flat tree][] after this [section of content][]; and
- has an [accessible name][] that communicates that it skips this [section of content][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] have already been identified within the test target, for example by comparison with other test targets within the same website, or any other means.
- This rule assumes that that [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123] requires the that the link can be activated by use of keyboard only.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123]
- [CSSâ€¯Scoping (work in progress)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)

## Test Cases

**Note**: The text of the examples is from the translation of the first Chapter of _The Three Kingdoms_ by Yu Sumei (Tuttle publishing, May 2014).

**Note**: Unless specified otherwise, the [sections of content][section of content] of each document are defined by the [landmarks][landmark] (`aside` and `main` elements), and the complementary [section of content][] (`aside` element`) is a [section of repeated content][] which does not include any [focusable][] not shown explicitly.

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The navigational [section of repeated content][] starts with a `link` that jumps to after it. Note that even if the target of the link is not itself a [focusable][] element, keyboard focus is still moving there and sequential focus navigation will continue from that point after activating the link.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<aside>
		<a href="#main">Skip additional information</a>
		<h1>About the book</h1>
		<!-- short description of the book and biography of the authors, repeated on each page -->
		<!-- does not include any focusable element -->
	</aside>
	<main id="main">
		<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The link to skip the navigational [section of repeated content][] is located just before it.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<a href="#main">Skip additional information</a>
	<aside>
		<h1>About the book</h1>
		<!-- short description of the book and biography of the authors, repeated on each page -->
		<!-- does not include any focusable element -->
	</aside>
	<main id="main">
		<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The link to skip the [section of repeated content][] is not normally [visible][] but becomes so when [focused][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<style>
			.skip-link {
				position: absolute;
				top: -999px;
			}

			.skip-link:focus {
				position: relative;
				top: 0;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<aside>
			<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip additional information</a>
			<h1>About the book</h1>
			<!-- short description of the book and biography of the authors, repeated on each page -->
			<!-- does not include any focusable element -->
		</aside>
		<main id="main">
			<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
			Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
			time.
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

The `div` element just before the [section of repeated content][] has a [semantic role][] of `link`, can be [focused][] and activated by keyboard only, and skip the [section of repeated content][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<div role="link" onclick="location.href='#main';" tabindex="1" id="skip-link">Skip additional information</div>
	<aside>
		<h1>About the book</h1>
		<!-- short description of the book and biography of the authors, repeated on each page -->
		<!-- does not include any focusable element -->
	</aside>
	<main id="main">
		<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
	<script>
		var link = document.getElementById('skip-link')

		link.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
			if (event.key === 'Enter') {
				event.preventDefault()
				link.click()
			}
		})
	</script>
</html>
```
