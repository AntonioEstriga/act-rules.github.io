- is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree); and
- is [visible](#visible) when [focused](#focused); and
- refers to an element within the same [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) located immediately after this [section of content](#section-of-content); and
- has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) that communicates that it skips this [section of content](#section-of-content).
