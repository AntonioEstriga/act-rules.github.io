## Applicability

This rule applies to any `frameset` element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

**Note**: `frameset` and `frame` are deprecated in HTML5. This rule is for testing older pages which used them in the first place. It is not a good idea to add `frameset` and `frame` to pages that do not contain any.

## Expectations

Each `frame` element which is a child of the target `frameset` and is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree) has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) that is not only [withespaces](#whitespace).

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H64)
