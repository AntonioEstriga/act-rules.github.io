## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element.

## Expectations

The first [focusable][#focusable] element of the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element)
- has [semantic role][#semantic-role] of link; and
- has an [accessible name][#accessible-name] that is not only [whitespaces][whitespace]; and
- is [visible][visible] when [focused][#focused]; and
- refers to an element within the same [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document).

**Note**: This rule does not check the pertinence of the link (does it goes to the main content area?) Therefore, passing this rule is not enough to satisfy WCAG technique [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1).

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that any global dismissible information that only appears once per site has already been acknowledged and is not displayed any more.

**Note**: the aim of such a link is to be able to skip repeated content (headers, navigation bar, ...) when viewing several pages of the same site. Many sites display a cookies policy banner which is stealing focus until dismissed (usually be viewing and accepting cookies policy). Since that content is *not* repeated (is it only shown once for the full site), it is not a problem to have it, and it may appear on any page of the site (depending where the user first comes in).

## Accessibility Support
