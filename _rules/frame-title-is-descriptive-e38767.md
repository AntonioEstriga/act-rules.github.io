## Applicability

This rule applies to any `frame` element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree) and has a `title` attribute whose value is not only [withespaces](#whitespace).

**Note**: `frame` and `frameset` are deprecated in HTML5. This rule is for testing older pages which used them in the first place. It is not a good idea to add `frame` and `frameset` to pages that do not contain any.

## Expectations

The `title` attribute describes the content of the `frame`.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background
