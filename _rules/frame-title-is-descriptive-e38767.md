## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element and contains at least one `frameset` element.

**Note**: `frame` and `frameset` are deprecated in HTML5. This rule is for testing older pages which used them in the first place. It is not a good idea to add `frame` and `frameset` to pages that do not contain any.

## Expectations

The `title` attribute of each `frame` element within the test target that has one describes the content of the `frame`.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._
