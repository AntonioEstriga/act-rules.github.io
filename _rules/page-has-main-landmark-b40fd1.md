  This rule checks that each page has an element with a semantic role of `main`
accessibility_requirements:

  - DOM Tree
  - CSS styling

## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element.

## Expectations

The [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) has at least one [descendant](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom41/#concept-tree-descendant) in the [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#flat-tree) with a [semantic role][#semantic-role] of [`main`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#main).

**Note**: Authors SHOULD not use more than one element with a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of [`main`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#main). This is, however, a not a requirement for this rule nor for technique [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11).

**Note**: Technique [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11) is not clear as to how many landmarks are actually needed to satisfy it, hence it is not listed as an accessibility requirement for this rule. However, having a landmark to identify the primary content of a page is enough to satisfy [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html).

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that the `main` landmark is correctly used to identify the primary content of the page.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11)
- [ARIA Landmarks Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) has a one element with a role of `main`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><title>The Three Kingdoms (translation by Yu Sumei)</title></head>
  <h1>Contents</h1>
  <!-- list of links to each chapter -->
  <div role="main">
    <h1>Chapter one</h1>
    Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of time.
    <!-- rest of the text of Chapter one -->
    <h1>Chapter two</h1>
    <!-- text of the next chapter -->
  </div>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) has several elements with a role of `main`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><title>Comparing translations of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms</title></head>
  <div role="main" aria-label="Translation by C. H. Brewitt-Taylor">
    The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.
  </div>
  <div role="main" aria-label="Translation by Yu Sumei">
    Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of time.
  </div>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) has a one element with a role of `main`. The rule does not check whether the role is correctly used.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><title>The Three Kingdoms (translation by Yu Sumei)</title></head>
  <div role="main">
    <h1>Contents</h1>
    <!-- list of links to each chapter -->
  </div>
  <h1>Chapter one</h1>
  Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of time.
  <!-- rest of the text of Chapter one -->
  <h1>Chapter two</h1>
  <!-- text of the next chapter -->
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This [document](#https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) has no element with a role of `main`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><title>The Three Kingdoms (translation by Yu Sumei)</title></head>
  <h1>Chapter one</h1>
  Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of time.
  <!-- rest of the text of Chapter one -->
  <h1>Chapter two</h1>
  <!-- text of the next chapter -->
</html>
```
