## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

For each [section of repeated content][] in the test target, there exists some [user interface component][] which:

- is [visible][]; and
- is [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- allows to toggle both [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of this [section of repeated content][].

**Note**: the same [user interface component][] may be used for several or even all the [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content].

**Note**: [Technique SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28] does not require the [accessible name][] of the [user interface component][] to be descriptive.

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] have already been identified within the test target, for example by comparison with other test targets within the same website, or any other means.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28]

## Test Cases

**Note**: The text of the examples is from the translation of the first Chapter of _The Three Kingdoms_ by Yu Sumei (Tuttle publishing, May 2014).

**Note**: Unless specified otherwise, the [sections of content][section of content] of each document are defined by the [landmarks][landmark] (`nav` and `main` elements), and the navigational [section of content][] (`nav` element) is a [section of repeated content][].

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The [visibility][visible] of the navigational [section of repeated content][] can be toggled on and off by the link at the start of the document.

```html
<html>
	<script src="../test-assets/block-collapsible-3e12e1/toggle-visibility.js" />
	<a href="#" onclick="toggleVisibility('navigation')">Toggle table of content</a>
	<nav id="navigation">
		<h1>Contents</h1>
		<!-- list of links to each chapter -->
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1><span>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</span></h1>
		Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
		time.
	</main>
</html>
```
