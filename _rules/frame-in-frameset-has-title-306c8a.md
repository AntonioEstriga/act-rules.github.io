## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document) where the [document element](#https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document-element) is an HTML `html` element and contains at least one `frameset` element.

**Note**: `frame` and `frameset` are deprecated in HTML5. This rule is for testing older pages which used them in the first place. It is not a good idea to add `frame` and `frameset` to pages that do not contain any.

## Expectations

Each `frame` element within the test target:
- is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree); and
- has a `title` attribute whose value is not only [withespaces](#whitespace).

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H64)
