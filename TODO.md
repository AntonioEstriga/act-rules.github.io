- get report scripts running
- pull out `rgaa` and `axe` into separate repos (under act-rules)
- use the level access data from `alistair` and set up a new repo for the same.




- automate axe implementation report generation on every build


Things to display:
- https://act-rules.github.io/pages/implementations/reporting/
  - add other implementors
  - ensure version number exists for all implementations
  - view report links to the json file (above repos)
- Rules page
  - show implentation count (eg: 3)

- Rule page
  - show list of implementations after changelog
  - check if `complete===true` and only then show tool as implementation
  - view report links to the json file (above repos)


- Build time
  - create a template page in gatsby build time for representing above json reports as tables. (no link in sidebar)
