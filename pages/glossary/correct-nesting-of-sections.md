Two [sections of content][] are _correctly nested_ if all the text content of one of them is included into the other.

**Note:** [Sections of content][] of the same kind ([explicit][], [implicit][], or [visual][]) are always correctly nested by definition.

[explicit]: #explicit-section-of-content 'Definition of explicit section of content'
[implicit]: #implicit-section-of-content 'Definition of implicit section of content'
[sections of content]: #section-of-content 'Definition of section of content'
[visual]: #visual-section-of-content 'Definition of visual section of content'
