Something in the line of "a subtree rooted at an element with distinguishing style" using https://github.com/act-rules/act-rules.github.io/blob/896b28caeb240171d3b2db626506a7c6034ce20b/pages/glossary/distinguishing-styles.md

+note that these only make sense for sighted users and users of AT need to rely on something else.

Problem: the def linked above is about distinguishing between two elements. This def should be about the element being distinguishable from the surrounding.

Problem: this def needs some sort of "minimal size" for the section of content (otherwise, a link within a paragraph would be a visual section of content). Can likely be solved by requiring the section to contain at least one block level element.

Problem: getting a complete list of what can be used to distinguish a section of content might be difficult… We'll probably have to stop at "good enough" and be ready to expand the list if needed…
