title: Required Input Field
key: required-input-field
---

Any [input element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-input-element) that prevents the successful submission or processing of the input when left unfilled.

If the element is part of a form, having the [`required`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-required-attribute) attribute makes it a required control for form submission.
