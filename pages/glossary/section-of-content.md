title: Section of content
key: section-of-content
---

A distinct part or subdivision of a document.

A section of content may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections that together serve a purpose.

A section of the content may be defined in different ways, and combinations of these, such as:

- HTML markup, using WAI-ARIA landmarks or HTML5 sectioning elements.
- A heading that marks the beginning of the section of content.

**Editorial note**: In its current state, the definition of [section of content](#section-of-content) would include, *e.g.* an advertising sidebar as a specific section of content. However, it is not clear that the lack of link/heading for it would be a breach of G124/H69 or SC 2.4.1â€¦ Idea?
