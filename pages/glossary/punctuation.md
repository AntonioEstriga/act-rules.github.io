All characters in the [Unicode Punctuation categories](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/ch04.pdf#G134153), which are the following categories:

- Pc = Punctuation, connector
- Pd = Punctuation, dash
- Ps = Punctuation, open
- Pe = Punctuation, close
- Pi = Punctuation, initial quote (may behave like Ps or Pe depending on usage)
- Pf = Punctuation, final quote (may behave like Ps or Pe depending on usage)
- Po = Punctuation, other

In the [Unicode Character Database](https://unicode.org/ucd/) the [table of all Unicode characters](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) lists the category for each character, making it possible to locate all punctuation characters.

**Note:** The [Unicode Character Categories](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm) gives a more userfriendly, but not normative, overview of which characters are included in the different Unicode punctuation categories.
